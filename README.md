# AI-Coding-Assistant
---------------------------
##Abstract
AI-Coding-Assistant(stand for ACA) guides you towards that your codes be getting better and better.
It has representing 3-features.
1. Make codes of the suggested algorithms.
2. Detect errors with given your codes.
3. Give you advices so that you're improving your skills of coding.

##Model
ACA use [Starcoder][https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder] which is opensource text-generation AI model by [BigCode][https://huggingface.co/bigcode]
Starcoder can make instructions against we ask algorithms for them quite well.
